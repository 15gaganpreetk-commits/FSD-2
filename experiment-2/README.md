## 😒 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in the following areas:

* **Component-Based Architecture**
  Building reusable and modular UI components in React using best practices, including effective prop usage and state handling with components such as Button, TextField, Rating, and Checkbox.

* **State Management with React Hooks**
  Using the `useState` hook to manage component state, handle user interactions, and dynamically update the user interface in functional components.

* **Component-Level Styling**
  Applying scoped CSS for individual components to maintain consistent styling, responsiveness, and smooth UI interactions such as hover effects and transitions.

* **Form Handling in React**
  Implementing controlled form components, managing form state, handling user input, and processing form submissions with multiple input types.

* **Component Integration and Routing**
  Composing multiple components to build complete pages like Home, About, and Contact, and managing navigation and data flow between components.

## 🔀 Routing and Navigation

This project uses client-side routing to manage navigation within a single-page application. Routing allows different pages to be displayed based on the URL while keeping the application fast and responsive, without reloading the browser.

### 🔗 Navigation Links

The application includes navigation links that allow users to move between different pages such as Home, About, and Contact. These links update the URL and display the corresponding page content instantly, providing a smooth user experience.

### 🧭 Page Routing

Each page in the application is associated with a specific route. When a user navigates to a particular URL, the matching page component is rendered automatically. This approach helps organize the application into clear, separate sections while maintaining a single-page structure.

### ✅ Advantages of Using Routing

* Enables smooth navigation without page refresh
* Improves performance and user experience
* Keeps URLs clean and meaningful
* Supports modular and scalable application structure
