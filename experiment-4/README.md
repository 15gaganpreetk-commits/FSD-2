📌 State Management in React
📖 Introduction

State Management is the technique of managing application data (state) so that the user interface updates correctly in response to user actions and events.

🧩 Local State

Local State is maintained within a single React component and is commonly managed using hooks such as useState.

Features:

Restricted to one component

Simple and easy to manage

Not shared with other components

Applications:
Form fields, counters, toggles

🌐 Global State

Global State is used when application data needs to be accessed by multiple components.

🔹 Context API

Context API is a built-in React mechanism for sharing state globally without prop drilling.

Features:

Reduces unnecessary prop passing

Ideal for small to medium applications

Applications:
Theme management, authentication status

🔹 Redux

Redux is an external state management library designed for large and complex applications.

Features:

Centralized state store

Predictable state updates

Scalable architecture

Applications:
Complex data flow and shared application state
