# Experiment 3 – Learning Outcomes

## Learning Outcomes: Links, Routing, and Router

1. **Grasping the Basics of React Router**

   * Gain a clear understanding of how React Router is installed and configured in a single-page application (SPA) to support seamless client-side navigation without triggering full page reloads.

2. **Creating Navigation Using Links**

   * Learn to effectively use the `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components to build intuitive navigation systems that allow users to move between routes smoothly within the application.

3. **Route Definition and Organization**

   * Understand how to create and manage routes using route configurations, including nested routing and dynamic route parameters, to design scalable and well-structured applications.

4. **Handling Route Data and URL Parameters**

   * Develop the ability to retrieve and use URL parameters and query strings for transferring data between components and controlling application behavior based on the active route.

5. **Programmatic Routing and Access Control**

   * Learn how to navigate between routes programmatically using the `useNavigate` hook and implement route-guarding techniques to restrict access based on authentication or authorization rules.
