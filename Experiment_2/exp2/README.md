# Experiment 2

## Learning Outcomes



1. Build reusable React components- Create modular, self-contained components (Button, Checkbox, Rating) that can be easily integrated into larger applications.

2. Implement form controls and interactions - Develop interactive UI elements with proper state management and event handling for user inputs.

3. Manage component state with React hooks - Use useState and other React hooks to manage component state effectively and respond to user interactions.

4. Create single-page applications (SPA) - Build a navigation structure that allows seamless switching between multiple views without full page reloads.

5. Style React components with CSS - Apply CSS styling to React components and ensure consistent visual appearance across different component types
