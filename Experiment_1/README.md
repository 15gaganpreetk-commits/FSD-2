# Experiment 1: SPA vs MPA

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understanding Single Page Applications (SPA) - Learn how SPAs load content dynamically without full page refreshes, providing a seamless user experience similar to native applications while reducing server load.

2. Understanding Multi Page Applications (MPA) - Understand how MPAs function with traditional server-side routing where each user interaction triggers a new page load, offering better SEO optimization and simpler initial setup.

3. Performance Comparison - Analyze the performance differences between SPAs and MPAs, including initial load time, subsequent navigation speed, and resource consumption on both client and server.

4. State Management and Data Flow- Master state management techniques in SPAs using React components and understand how data flows differently in SPAs compared to the request-response cycle of MPAs.

5. SEO and Accessibility Considerations - Evaluate SEO implications of SPAs versus MPAs, understanding how search engines index single-page applications and implementing strategies to improve discoverability in both architectures.
