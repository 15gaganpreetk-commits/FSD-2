## 📌 Description

This experiment focuses on creating a **user login form** using **React (Vite)** and **Material UI (MUI)**. It covers handling user input through React state, validating form fields in real time, and designing a clean, responsive interface. The implementation demonstrates how modern UI component libraries can be combined with React to build interactive and user-friendly forms commonly used in real-world web applications.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, the learner will be able to:

1. Develop form elements as **controlled inputs** in React and manage their values using state.
2. Perform **client-side form validation** using built-in browser validation along with custom validation rules.
3. Implement and customize **Material UI form components** such as TextField, Button, Checkbox, and Radio for structured form design.
4. Display **real-time validation feedback and error messages** based on user actions and input conditions.
5. Design a **responsive and visually consistent user interface** by integrating React components with CSS styling.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Through this experiment, the learner gains practical experience in building and validating forms in a React application using a modern UI framework. The concepts covered here—state handling, validation logic, and UI composition—are essential for developing scalable, user-friendly web interfaces and form the foundation for implementing more complex input-driven features in full-stack applications.
